Explanation:
Initial Values:

x is initialized to 100.
y is initialized to 300.
while Loop Condition:

The while loop condition is ++x < --y.
++x increments x by 1 and then evaluates the new value.
--y decrements y by 1 and then evaluates the new value.
Iteration Process:

On each iteration of the loop:
x is incremented (++x).
y is decremented (--y).
The loop continues to execute as long as the condition ++x < --y holds true.
Detailed Iteration:
First Iteration:

Before iteration: x = 100, y = 300
After ++x: x becomes 101
After --y: y becomes 299
Condition 101 < 299 is true, so the loop body executes.
Second Iteration:

Before iteration: x = 101, y = 299
After ++x: x becomes 102
After --y: y becomes 298
Condition 102 < 298 is true, so the loop body executes.
Subsequent Iterations:

This process continues with x increasing and y decreasing.
Termination:

The loop will terminate when ++x is no longer less than --y.
Finding the Termination Point:
Letâ€™s compute when ++x is no longer less than --y:

After n iterations:
x will be 100 + n
y will be 300 - n
The condition to check is 100 + n < 300 - n
Simplifying, 2n < 200
Thus, n < 100
So, the loop will terminate after n = 99 iterations.

Final Values:
At the end of the loop:
x = 100 + 99 = 199
y = 300 - 99 = 201
After the final increment and decrement:
++x will be 200
--y will be 200
The loop condition 200 < 200 is false.
Summary:
The while loop will run 99 times. After the loop terminates, x will be 200 and y will be 200.
