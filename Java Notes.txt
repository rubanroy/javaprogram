Java Notes :

Yes, "the main() method can be overloaded in Java". Overloading occurs when you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class.

For example, you can have:

public class MainMethodOverloadExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method with String[] args");
        main(10);
    }

    public static void main(int number) {
        System.out.println("Overloaded main method with int parameter: " + number);
    }
}
In this example, there are two main() methods:

public static void main(String[] args) — the standard entry point for the Java application.
public static void main(int number) — an overloaded version of main() with an int parameter.
The Java runtime environment (JRE) specifically looks for the main(String[] args) method as the entry point of the application. Any overloaded versions of main() are not used by the JRE to start the application but can be called from other methods within the program.
